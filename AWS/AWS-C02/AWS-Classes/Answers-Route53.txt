1) CNAME - The DNS protocol does not allow you to create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (mycoolcompany.com), also known as the zone apex
2) Weighted - Weighted allows you to redirect a part of the traffic based on a weight (hence a percentage). It's common to use to send a part of a traffic to a new application you're deploying
3) Its because of TTL - DNS records have a TTL (Time to Live) in order for clients to know for how long to caches these values and not overload the DNS with DNS requests. TTL should be set to strike a balance between how long the value should be cached vs how much pressure should go on the DNS.
4) Latency - Latency will evaluate the latency results and help your users get a DNS response that will minimize their latency (e.g. response time)
5) GeoLocation
6) Create a public hosted zone and update the 3rd party registrar NS records - Private hosted zones are meant to be used for internal network queries and are not publicly accessible. Public Hosted Zones are meant to be used for people requesting your website through the public internet. Finally, NS records must be updated on the 3rd party registrar.
