1) My EC2 Instance does not have the permissions to perform an API call PutObject on S3. What should I do?
   (I should run 'aws configure' and put access key and secret key to put somehing in the s3)
   (Should add IAM role to the instance)
   (I should use instance metadata api call)
2) I have an on-premise personal server that I'd like to use to perform AWS API calls
   (I should run 'aws configure' and put access key and secret key to put somehing in the s3)
   (Should add IAM role to the instance)
3) I need my colleagues help to debug my code. When he runs the application on his machine, it's working fine, whereas I get API authorisation exceptions. What should I do?
   (Send your access and secret key so that he can replicate the issue you are facing)
   (compare your both iam policy's and understand the differences)
   (Ask his credentials to access the application which saves lot of time in troubleshooting)
4) To get the instance id of my EC2 machine from the EC2 machine, the best thing is to...
   (Create an IAM role and attach it to the instance and perform desired acions)
