1) Your instance in us-east-1a just got terminated, and the attached EBS volume is now available. Your colleague tells you he can't seem to attach it to your instance in us-east-1b.
   (Missing IAM permissions)
   (EBS is region locked)
   (EBS is AZ locked)
2) You have provisioned an 8TB gp2 EBS volume and you are running out of IOPS. What is NOT a way to increase performance?
   (Mount EBS volume in RAID 0)
   (Change to i01 volume type)
   (Increase the volume size)
3) You would like to leverage EBS volumes in parallel to linearly increase performance, while accepting greater failure risks. Which RAID mode helps you in achieving that?
   (RAID 0, 1, 5, 6)
4) Although EBS is already a replicated solution, your company SysOps advised you to use a RAID mode that will mirror data and will allow your instance to not be affected if an EBS volume entirely fails. Which RAID mode did he recommend to you?
   (RAID 0,1)
5) You would like to have the same data being accessible as an NFS drive cross AZ on all your EC2 instances. What do you recommend?
   (EBS, EFS, Instance store)
6) You would like to have a high performance cache for your application that mustn't be shared. You don't mind losing the cache upon termination of your instance. Which storage mechanism do you recommend as a Solution Architect?
   (EBS, EFS, Instance store)
7)  You are running a high-performance database that requires an IOPS of 210,000 for its underlying filesystem. What do you recommend?
   (EbS gp2, EBS io1, EFS, Instance store)
